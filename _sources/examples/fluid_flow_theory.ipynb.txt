    "Fluid flow occurs in the annular space between the shaft and the bearing, both of $ L $ length. These structures are called rotor and stator, respectively.

    "It is important to note that this change in pressure behavior due to cavitation does not necessarily start at the point of least thickness in the annular space. Several studies seek to establish the appropriate boundary conditions to describe the beginning of cavitation in the fluid. ISHIDA and YAMAMOTO (2012) [2] indicate that the condition of Gumbel is widely used because of its simplicity. Using the argument that lubricant evaporation and axial air flow from both ends can occur, the pressure in the region $\\pi < \\theta < 2\\pi $ is considered to be almost zero (that is, the atmospheric pressure ). $p = 0 $ is then defined across the divergent region.\n",
